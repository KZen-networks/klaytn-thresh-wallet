# Klaytn Threshold Wallet

Klaytn wallet and JS SDK powered by two-party ECDSA.

## Usage
Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/KZen-networks/klaytn-thresh-wallet.git
$ cd klaytn-thresh-wallet
```
Server (acts as the co-signer in the two-party signing protocol):
```js
const { Party1 } = require('../index');
const p1 = new Party1();
p1.launchServer();
```
Client:
```js
const Caver = require('../index');
const caver = new Caver('https://api.baobab.klaytn.net:8651/');
const caverUtils = caver.utils;

(async function () {
    const {share, address} = await caver.klay.accounts.createFromTwoParty();
    console.log(address);
    // 0x477d627398FE73f4610c6EdC24218b78671E7991

    /* Now deposit some Klaytn to the address created above */

    caver.klay.accounts.wallet.addWithPrivateShare(
        share,
        address
    );
    const signedTx = await caver.klay.accounts.signTransactionWithShare({
        type: 'VALUE_TRANSFER',
        from: address,
        to: address,  // or whatever destination address
        gas: '300000',
        value: caverUtils.toPeb(klay_amount)
    }, share);

    const result = await caver.klay.sendSignedTransaction(signedTx.rawTransaction);
    console.log(result);
})();
```

## Demo
You can also use the **CLI demo** to test the functionality of two-party signing scheme.<br>
Server:
```sh
$ demo/server
ðŸ”§ Configured for development.
    => address: localhost
    => port: 8000
    => log: critical
    => workers: 24
    => secret key: private-cookies disabled
    => limits: forms = 32KiB
    => keep-alive: 5s
    => tls: disabled
ðŸš€ Rocket has launched from http://localhost:8000
```
Client:
```sh
$ demo/client --help
Usage: client [options] [command]

Options:
  -h, --help                                                    output usage information

Requirements
=================
The following packages are required to use the caver-js library.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [gcc-c++](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

Testing in caver-js is implemented using the mocha testing framework. If you want to run unit tests in caver-js, you need to install mocha first.
- [mocha](https://mochajs.org/#installation)

**Note** caver-js can run on Node.js versions 8 and 10, and the recommended versions are:
- lts/carbon ([8.16.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/))
- lts/dubnium ([10.16.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/))

If you are already using a different version of the node(for example, node v12), use the Node Version Manager([NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) to install and use the version supported by caver-js.


Installation
=================
To try it out, install caver-js with npm like following command:

```
$ npm install caver-js
```

**Note** `package.json` file should exist on the same install path.  If it
does not exist, `package.json` should be generated via `npm init`.

To install a specific version of caver-js, try the following command:
```
$ npm install caver-js@X.X.X
```

Getting Started
=================
If you want to run your own EN (Endpoint Node), see [EN Operation Guide](https://docs.klaytn.com/node/en) to set up. You can also use Klaytn Public EN like below:
```
$ node
> const Caver = require('caver-js')
> const caver = new Caver('https://api.baobab.klaytn.net:8651/')
```
**Note** The above example should be executed from the location where caver-js is installed, and the example is explained using [Node.js REPL](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html#repl_the_node_js_repl).

## Check the Connection
You can now use caver-js. You can send a basic request to the node as shown below and check the results.
